## Project Overview

This project was commissioned by Rotary District 7040 to streamline and digitize their Rotary grant application, pledge tracking, and reporting processes. The development of this application started in January 2022, as part of my final year project while I was a student at Algonquin College. The application is currently in Version 1.0.0, with plans for continuous improvement and scalability to support future districts.

## Features

- **Grant Application Management:** Streamline the process of applying for Rotary grants with an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- **Pledge Tracking:** Keep track of pledges made by members and ensure transparency and accountability in the pledge management process.
- **Reporting:** Generate detailed reports on grant applications, pledges, and project statuses to keep all stakeholders informed.
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and authentication system to ensure that only authorized users can access the application admin panel.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Differentiate access levels and permissions based on user roles (e.g., admin, standard member).
- **Data Visualization:** Utilize Chart.js to provide visual representations of data, making it easier to understand trends and insights.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure the application is accessible and functional on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
