## Project Overview

This project was commissioned by Rotary District 7040 to streamline and digitize their Rotary grant application, pledge tracking, and reporting processes. The development of this application started in January 2022, as part of my final year project while I was a student at Algonquin College. The application is currently in Version 1.0.0, with plans for continuous improvement and scalability to support future districts.
